# these are the steps I used to extract audio to work on voxonomy

1. download yt-dl, ffmpeg, and ffprobe
2. yt-dlp -x --progress --write-subs --write-auto-subs -audio-quality 7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ahOOnOXs4c&pp=ygUYaHViZXJtYW4gbGFiIGNsaXBzIGF0dGlh

As context to the code above:
	-x extracts audio only without downloading the video itself
	--progress displays a progress bar until completion
	--write-subs downloads available subtitles for the video and saves them in a separate video
	--audio quality 7, this sets the audio quality but it didn't work so I wouldn't include it.
	the video URL is specified after that

3. Finally, I needed an mp3 version of the data (maybe needed is too strong a word) so I used ffmpeg to modify the format.

ffmpeg -i input.opus -vn -ar 44100 -ac 2 output.mp3

Explanation of options:
	-i: Input file
	-vn: Disable video (if any)
	-ar: Set audio sample rate to 44100 Hz (common for MP3)
	-ac: Set number of audio channels to 2 (stereo)
	output.mp3: Output file name
